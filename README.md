The Mobile Phone Price Prediction project focuses on predicting the price of 
mobile phones based on various features such as ratings, RAM, ROM, mobile size, 
primary camera, selfie camera, and battery power. Using statistical analysis 
methods in R, the study employs regression models including linear, nonlinear, and 
multiple linear regressions to analyze these features.
Purpose and Objectives:   The objective of this study is to develop regression models 
to predict mobile phone prices. By analyzing key factors such as RAM, camera 
quality, and storage capacity, the study aims to provide valuable insights that could 
help manufacturers and retailers optimize pricing strategies. The project also 
evaluates the effectiveness of linear versus nonlinear models to better understand 
the relationship between the features and prices.
Significance:   The study provides a comprehensive analysis of how various mobile 
phone features influence pricing, helping manufacturers and retailers to set prices 
competitively. It also highlights the need for non-linear models, suggesting that 
simple linear approaches may miss complex patterns in pricing
